# Sheet-Music-Reader
Computer Vision project: Sheet music reader, Reads in an image of sheet music and plays back (Simple sheet music)

#### Programming language: MatLab

#### Features:

* Plays simple sheet music
* Plays all scales
* Displays notes and scales

#### Shortcomings:
* General flow of the program can only play simple sheet musics. (No rest symbols, accidentals, single quarter notes, 
acciaccatura and notes smaller than eighth notes)

* Plays notes only from 2nd Octave 'G' to 4th Octave 'C' on the Bass Cleft and from 4th Octave 'C' to 5th Octave 'G' on Treble Cleft

* This specific program on my GitHub profile can play the given images perfectly, but for other images the images for notes
must be appropriately selected using MatLab's 'imcrop' function. (For more details, please message me: gauthamv93@yahoo.com)
